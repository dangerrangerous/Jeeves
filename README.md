Jeeves is a command line tool used for copying files and enumerating them sequentially.

When rendering an animation that has, say, 60 frames (2+ seconds) of 'still image', instead of rendering the same image 60 times you can copy and paste the image 60 times. However, in order to create a png sequence in software such as AfterEffects the file names must be organized in a specific way.

Instead of hand copying and renaming each file, Jeeves can take the file path and the number of copies you want and generate them for you.

This is currently a bare bones script with no error checking or user interface, so be warned.

The file format is: filename.number.extension
ex: C:/path/to/file/tacocat.0001.png

Jeeves will place the copies in the same directory as the original file.
